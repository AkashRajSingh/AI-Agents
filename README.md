AI Agents: Experiments, Research, and Implementations

This repository is a collection of hands-on projects, implementations, and explorations focused on AI Agents and their underlying frameworks. It includes practical experiments with autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, tool integrations, and real-world applications. The goal is to bridge theory and practiceâ€”transforming cutting-edge concepts into working solutions and prototypes.

Whether you're exploring prompt-driven workflows, agent orchestration, or advanced planning and reasoning, this repo provides structured examples, modular code, and insights into building intelligent, adaptive systems.

Focus Areas:

Single and Multi-Agent Architectures

Tool-Using Agents

LLM-Powered Autonomous Agents

Planning, Memory, and Reasoning Components

Real-World Use Cases
